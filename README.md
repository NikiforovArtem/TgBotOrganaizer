My little pet project that implements notes via a bot in a telegram. Aimed at learning MongoDb technologies, as well as experience in building clean Architecture applications with domain level design in DDD style.
Can be used as a template for building new services.

The bot itself has commands:
1 "/ get ~ theme ~" gets a note on a topic
2 "/ post ~ theme ~ your text" adds / updates a note. To add a picture, you need to throw the same command into the caption.
3 "/ getallthemes" - get all existing note themes
